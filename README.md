## How It Works

### Daily Schedule
```math
Weekly Total = Œ£ (Mon + Tue + Wed + Thu + Fri + Sat)
Monthly Total = Weekly Total √ó 4

Monthly Tracking
math
Copy

Partial Month Total = (Weeks Passed √ó Weekly Total) + Extra Days
Attended = (Current % √ó Partial Month Total) / 100
Missed = Partial Month Total - Attended

Term Tracking
math
Copy

Partial Term Total = (Months Passed √ó Monthly Total) + (Weeks √ó Weekly Total) + Extra Days
Term Attended = (Term % √ó Partial Term Total) / 100
